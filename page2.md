<h1>Registers</h1>
<p>Let's learn about <strong>register</strong></p>

<p>The Cambridge Dictionary defines register as "the style of language, grammar, and words used for particular situations". Although you may not realise it, register exists in practically every language, including English and French. Take, for example, the difference between the word 'friend' and 'mate'; whereas the first is more standard and therefore its use more flexible, the second can sound out of place when used in a more formal setting (i.e. a job interview). The 'particular situations' that affect the language we adopt concern depend on our relationship with the other speaker: how familiar are they and what authority (if any) do they have over us? Another factor is location: where is the communication taking place? A conversation in a bar is likely to be much more informal than one in a courtroom. 
<br>Concerning the French language, Lodge et al. (1997: 27) explain how French dictionaries commonly seperate language into six registers: </p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
  <li><i>vulgaire</i> (crude and disrespectful)</li>
  <li><i>argotique</i> (slang)</li>
  <li><i>populaire</i> (very informal, reserved for very close friends. Can have negative connotations)</li>
  <li><i>familier</i> (demonstrates a closer, more intimate relationship)</li>
  <li><i>courant</i> (the standard, taught to those learning French as a second language and acceptable in nearly any situation)</li>
  <li><i>cultivé/soutenu</i> (respectful and formal, though can sound stilted in more relaxed environments)</li>
</ul>
<p>The linguists then describe how each of these levels of style "[...]shade[s] into one another to form a continuum without a sharp natural break[...]" and thus forms what they term a 'stylistic continuum' (1997: 27). This means, for example, that words classed as <i>familier</i> may be acceptable in situations where the predominant register is <i>courant</i>: the borders between registers on the scale are not clearly defined. Those between seperated registers, however, definitely are: <i>vulgaire</i> vocabulary is to be in all cases avoided in a cultivated (<i>cultivé</i>) setting.
