<h1>Welcome to the French Register Index</h1>

<p>This website aims to teach you about French language registers, why they are important and when to use them; knowing this will eventually improve your language level in making your French usage much more context-appropriate. This applies equally to your comprehension of the language: take for instance a poem by Baudelaire (represented above) and compare it to a modern day French newspaper article; you will notice that the language used differs considerably, and understanding why will help decipher in what sense words and expressions are being used.</p>
