<h1>Vocab</h1>
<p>Let's learn some <strong>vocab</strong></p>

<p>Now that we've learnt what registers are (or if you already knew what they were), it's time to apply this to vocabulary. As we have seen, different lexical items (words) belong to different registers; this page, through games and vocab lists, will help to learn new vocabulary alongside its accompanying language level. This is a good learning tip, as it avoids inappropriate language use that sounds awkward and out of place!
