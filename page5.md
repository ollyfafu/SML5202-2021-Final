<h1>Listening</h1>
<p>Let's get <strong>listening</strong></p>

<p>As discussed earlier, written French constitutes one means of communication (or <i>mode</i>) and spoken French another. Between the two modes, there are numerous differences; here is a quick summary: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Speech relies on <strong>sound and listening</strong>, writing on <strong>sight and text</strong></li>
  <li>Speech takes place in a <strong>shared context</strong> where references are mutually understood and <strong>body language can be used</strong></li>
  <li>In writing everything must be explained because there is <strong>no shared context</strong></li>
  <li>Writing is mostly <strong>planned</strong> while speech is <strong>spontaneous</strong></li>
  <li>Speech is <strong>simultaneously</strong> produced and recieved (by a listener), whilst in writing there is <strong>a gap</strong> between production and reception</li>
</ul>

<p>To get used to the spoken mode, language <strong>input</strong> is very important: here is an exercise to start you off!</p>

<p>Register also expresses itself in pronunciation. In formal French, you will hear much more <i>liaison</i> (the linking of a normally unpronounced final consonant of one word with the vowel that begins the following one). Here's what it sounds like, so you know how to recognise <i>liaisons</i> and therefore formal spoken register in future:</p>

<p>As you can hear, the usually unpronounced final <i>s</i> of <i>ils</i> is joined here to the beginning <i>o</i> of <i>ont</i>. The resulting <i>z</i> sound is the <i>liaison</i>. This type of <i>liaison</i> is compulsory no matter what register, yet there are others that are only appropriate in more formal settings.</p>
<p>As the language of poetry normally falls into a literary and therefore more <i>soutenu</i> (formal) register, the use of <i>liaison</i> in poems is quite noticeable. Listen to this poem and see how many <i>liaisons</i> you can pick up!</p>
